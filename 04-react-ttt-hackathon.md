# React Tic-Tac-Toe Hackathon

## Intro

Hackathons are events, usually hosted by a tech company, where programmers team up to collaborate for a short period of time on a project.

Hackathons can be a competitive event with prizes awarded to the winning team(s).

Hackathons are a great learning experience and provide an opportunity to meet others and network.

## Assignment

Each team will work to code a Tic-Tac-Toe game in React.

### MVP

- Display an empty tic-tac-toe board when the app is initially displayed.

- Display a "message" section that states whose turn it is when the game is in play.  However, when the game is over, display which player has won or if the game was a tie.

- Once a square is occupied, the square cannot be played again.

- When the game is over, no squares can be clicked.

- Implement a **[Play Again]** button that displays only when the game is over and resets the game when clicked.

### Bonus

- Theme the game to display colors or images instead of Xs and Os.

- Render a scoreboard with the win count of the two players and ties.

## Setup

One team member needs to create a React sandbox in [codesandbox.io](https://codesandbox.io/).

All sandboxes by default allow for [live collaboration](https://codesandbox.io/docs/live) - just click the [Share] button, click the [Copy Sandbox Link] and share it with all teammates.

## Hints and Suggestions

### Refer to the Previous Tic-Tac-Toe Solution Code

- Refer to the solution code provided with the tic-tac-toe-weekend assignment on w01/d5.

- The solution code provides what state variables you are going to need (not including the bonus of keeping score) and how to implement the win logic.

### Refer to the React Fundamentals - Using and Updating State Lesson

The React Fundamentals - Using and Updating State Lesson had several references to the state specifically to a game of Tic-Tac-Toe.

Pay particular attention to how `winner` is **calculated** state, not state created using the useState hook.

### Fundamental Philosophy of React Frontend Programming

The following is fundamental to every React application...

- **In response to user-interaction, we perform any necessary calculations and update all impacted state causing the components to re-render.**

### Workflow

- Use the [Live Collaboration Feature](https://codesandbox.io/docs/live) of CodeSandbox.

- Mob program (where everyone focuses on the same code at the same time) or break up responsibilities, e.g., defining certain components, defining state, layout/CSS, etc. 

## Have Fun!
