# React Calendar - Part 2

## Intro

We will be adding to Part 1 of the React Calendar lab by adding a few color applicators to help you organize the days of your calendar.

## Setup

Continue working in the same [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) that you used for Part 1!

## Instructions

We're going to be adding the functionality to change the background color of each cell, in order to organize them by category.

> Note: Again, feel free to go with your own layout, colors, etc.


### Step 1

- You will need to add 4 (or more) color selectors above the calendar
- When the pages loads, your page should look like this:

### Step 2

- When you click on one of the categories at the top of the page (Holiday, Work, Errands, Sick), that category should be styled to show that it is "selected"
- You can see in the example below, the category "Holiday" has a glow/border to show that it is the selected category

> Note: How you choose to show a category is selected is up to you, even a simple border will work!

---

### Step 3

- After selecting a category at the top of the page, you should be able to click on any cell (day) in the calendar and apply the color of the category to the background color of the cell
- In our example, since we have selected "Holiday", clicking on any cell in the calendar should change the background color of that cell to gold
- Selecting a new category should un-select the previously selected category, and highlight the newly selected category

### Step 4
- Add the same functionality to each category, so that you can add each color to your calendar and organize your schedule by category
